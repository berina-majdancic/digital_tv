    <h1>How Digital TV Works</h1> 
    <p> Digital TV works by converting traditional analog audio and video signals into digital data—streams of binary code 
      consisting of 0s and 1s. This transformation allows for more efficient transmission, better quality, and greater flexibility
       in how content is delivered and received. The digital process involves several key steps, from compression to final display, 
       each playing a vital role in the viewer’s experience. </p> 
    
    <h2>1. Compression</h2> 
    <p> Before transmission, raw audio and video data are compressed using advanced codecs such as MPEG-2, MPEG-4, or H.264. 
      These compression technologies reduce the amount of data without significantly sacrificing quality. For example, redundant 
      information is eliminated, and only essential visual and audio details are retained. This process enables broadcasters to
       transmit high-definition content more efficiently and to fit more channels or services within the same bandwidth. </p>
      
    <h2>2. Transmission</h2> 
    <p> Once compressed, the digital signal is transmitted over various delivery platforms, including terrestrial broadcast 
      towers (over-the-air), coaxial or fiber-optic cable networks, satellites, or internet-based protocols (IPTV). 
      The chosen transmission method can affect the overall quality, reliability, and latency of the signal. For example, 
      satellite TV provides wide coverage but may be more sensitive to weather conditions, while IPTV can offer interactive services 
      and on-demand content over broadband connections. </p>
    
    <h2>3. Reception and Decoding</h2> 
    <p> At the receiving end, a digital tuner—integrated into the TV or provided via an external set-top box—captures the incoming 
      digital signal. This device decodes the compressed data, reconstructing the video and audio streams into a format the television
       can understand and present. Some receivers also support features like electronic program guides (EPGs), subtitles, and multiple 
       audio tracks, enhancing the viewing experience. </p> 
      
    <h2>4. Display</h2> 
    <p> After decoding, the signal is displayed on the television screen. The final quality depends on both the original broadcast 
      resolution and the capabilities of the display device. Standard-definition (SD), high-definition (HD), and ultra-high-definition 
      (4K or 8K) formats are all supported, depending on the setup. Modern televisions also apply image processing techniques such as
       motion smoothing, color enhancement, and upscaling to improve visual clarity and deliver a more immersive experience. </p> 
       
    <h2>5. Error Correction</h2> 
    <p> Digital TV systems employ error detection and correction mechanisms to maintain signal integrity, especially in environments
       with interference or weak reception. Techniques like forward error correction (FEC) identify and fix corrupted data in
        real-time, allowing for a stable and uninterrupted viewing experience. This is a major advantage over analog systems, 
        which could degrade into static or ghosting when the signal was weak. </p>
