    <h1>History of Digital Television</h1>
    <p>
      Digital television (DTV) represents a major shift from analog broadcasting. The first digital broadcasts appeared in the late 1990s and early 2000s, offering viewers better picture and sound quality, more channels, and interactive features.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Developments</h2>
    <p>
      The groundwork for DTV began in the 1980s and 1990s, driven by the rise of digital compression and transmission technologies. Japan’s NHK developed early high-definition systems, while the U.S. formed the ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) to create a DTV standard.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Adoption</h2>
    <p>
      Over the 2000s and 2010s, countries around the world transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts. Europe adopted DVB standards, the U.S. implemented ATSC, and Japan launched ISDB. Each region set its own switch-off timeline for analog signals.
    </p>

    <h2>Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1998:</strong> First digital TV broadcasts in the U.S.</li>
      <li><strong>2006:</strong> EU mandates digital switchover deadlines.</li>
      <li><strong>2009:</strong> U.S. officially ends analog broadcasting.</li>
      <li><strong>2012–2020:</strong> Many other countries complete their digital transitions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Digital TV made it possible to broadcast more channels over the same bandwidth, deliver high-definition content, and enable additional services like subtitles, interactive guides, and mobile TV. It laid the foundation for streaming and on-demand services.
