    <h1>Types of Digital Television</h1> 
    <p> Digital television is delivered through several platforms, each leveraging different technologies, infrastructures, and 
      business models. These delivery methods cater to various geographical regions, consumer needs, and technological capabilities. 
      Below are the main types of digital TV and how they function. </p>
      
    <h2>1. Terrestrial Digital TV (DTT)</h2> 
    <p> Terrestrial Digital Television (DTT), also known as over-the-air (OTA) broadcasting, transmits digital signals using radio 
      frequencies from land-based broadcast towers. Unlike analog terrestrial TV, DTT delivers clearer images, better sound quality,
       and often multiple channels within the same frequency band through digital multiplexing. </p> 
    <p> DTT is commonly used in both developed and developing nations due to its low cost and wide accessibility. In most countries,
         viewers only need a digital antenna and a TV with a built-in digital tuner or a set-top box. DTT services are often 
         free-to-air, making them a popular choice for public broadcasting, emergency messaging, and basic entertainment services. </p> 
         
    <h2>2. Satellite Digital TV</h2> 
    <p> Satellite TV broadcasts digital signals from communication satellites orbiting the Earth directly to a viewer’s satellite dish.
       It is ideal for reaching areas where cable or terrestrial signals are unreliable or unavailable, such as rural or mountainous 
       regions. </p> 
    <p> This type of service typically offers a large number of channels, including international content, 
        high-definition (HD) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) broadcasts. Providers like DirecTV (U.S.), Sky (UK), and DishTV (India) 
        use satellite networks to deliver subscription-based television packages. To access the service, consumers need a satellite 
        dish, a receiver or set-top box, and a subscription plan. </p> 
        
    <h2>3. Cable Digital TV</h2> 
    <p> Cable TV transmits digital television signals through physical coaxial or fiber-optic cables laid underground or on poles. 
      This infrastructure supports high bandwidth, allowing providers to offer hundreds of channels, HD/UHD content, and additional 
      services like pay-per-view, video on demand, and DVR recording. </p> 
    <p> Cable providers such as Comcast, Spectrum, and Virgin Media also bundle services like high-speed internet and telephone. Cable
       TV is typically available in urban and suburban areas, where laying and maintaining the infrastructure is economically viable.
        Consumers usually need a digital cable box or a cable card-enabled TV. </p> 
        
    <h2>4. IPTV (Internet Protocol Television)</h2> 
    <p> IPTV delivers digital television content using internet protocol (IP) networks, typically over a broadband connection managed
       by a telecom provider. Unlike traditional broadcast methods, IPTV is two-way and allows for real-time interactivity. </p> 
    <p> With IPTV, users can access live TV, video-on-demand (VoD), time-shifted viewing (catch-up TV), and interactive applications 
      such as weather, games, or personalized recommendations. Telecom companies like AT&T U-verse, BT TV (UK), and Telefónica Movistar
       (Spain) offer IPTV as part of bundled services. IPTV usually requires a set-top box connected to the internet and sometimes a 
       subscription to a broadband package. </p> 
       
    <h2>5. OTT (Over-the-Top) Streaming</h2> 
    <p> Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms deliver video content over the open internet without relying on traditional broadcast or cable 
      infrastructure. Content can be streamed on-demand to any device connected to the internet, including smart TVs, smartphones, 
      tablets, and computers. </p> <p> OTT services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, YouTube, Hulu, and HBO Max offer vast
         libraries of movies, series, documentaries, and original programming. Many OTT platforms use adaptive streaming technologies 
         to optimize quality based on available bandwidth, allowing for seamless viewing experiences. These services are often 
         subscription-based (SVOD), ad-supported (AVOD), or transaction-based (TVOD), offering flexibility to users. </p> 
         
    <h2>6. Hybrid Models</h2> 
    <p> Hybrid television combines traditional digital broadcast methods (like DTT or satellite) with internet-based features. 
      These systems enable broadcasters to offer enhanced interactivity, personalized content, and access to on-demand video alongside
       live programming. </p> <p> A prominent example is Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV), widely used in Europe. HbbTV allows 
        viewers to access additional services—such as program guides, news tickers, voting in live shows, and streaming apps—using
         the internet while watching regular TV broadcasts. Similar hybrid models are being explored globally as broadcasters seek to 
         merge the strengths of both broadcast and broadband delivery systems. </p> 
    <p> Hybrid solutions are especially attractive because they extend the capabilities of broadcast infrastructure without fully
       abandoning legacy systems, offering a more gradual transition to internet-based content consumption. </p>
