    <h1>Types of Digital Television</h1>

    <p>Digital TV can be delivered through various platforms, each using different technologies and infrastructure. The
      main types include:</p>

    <h2>1. Terrestrial Digital TV (DTT)</h2>
    <p>
      Also known as over-the-air digital TV, this type is broadcast using traditional terrestrial signals, but in
      digital format. It requires a digital antenna and is often free to access.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Satellite Digital TV</h2>
    <p>
      Delivered via satellites orbiting the Earth, this form of digital TV offers wide coverage, especially in rural or
      remote areas. It typically requires a satellite dish and receiver.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Cable Digital TV</h2>
    <p>
      Provided through coaxial or fiber optic cable networks, cable TV often includes bundled services such as internet
      and phone. It is subscription-based and commonly found in urban areas.
    </p>

    <h2>4. IPTV (Internet Protocol Television)</h2>
    <p>
      IPTV delivers digital TV content over internet networks. It's used by services like AT&T U-verse or Telef√≥nica
      Movistar and supports live TV, on-demand content, and interactivity.
    </p>

    <h2>5. OTT (Over-the-Top) Streaming</h2>
    <p>
      OTT platforms deliver content via the public internet, bypassing traditional broadcasters. Services like Netflix,
      YouTube, and Hulu fall under this category and are accessible on smart TVs, phones, or PCs.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Hybrid Models</h2>
    <p>
      Many modern setups combine traditional broadcast TV with internet features, such as HbbTV in Europe, which allows
      users to access additional information and streaming services alongside live channels.
