    <h1>Digital TV Standards</h1> 
    <p> Digital television is built upon a variety of regional and international broadcasting standards. These technical frameworks
       determine how audio and video data is encoded, transmitted, received, and decoded. The choice of standard affects picture 
       quality, compatibility, and the range of available features in each region. </p> 
       
    <h2>1. ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee)</h2> 
    <p> ATSC is the standard primarily used in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea. It supports both standard-definition
       (SD) and high-definition (HD) formats, offering improved image clarity over analog systems. The latest version, ATSC 3.0—also 
       known as "Next Gen TV"—introduces advanced features such as 4K resolution, HDR, immersive audio, targeted advertising, 
       interactive content, and internet integration. It also enables mobile and on-demand viewing experiences, bridging traditional 
       broadcasting with modern digital expectations. </p> 
       
    <h2>2. DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting)</h2> 
    <p> DVB is widely used in Europe, parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is a family of related standards, including DVB-T 
      (terrestrial), DVB-S (satellite), DVB-C (cable), and DVB-H (handheld). These formats support high-definition and 
      ultra-high-definition (UHD) broadcasts and are known for their scalability and flexibility. DVB standards are frequently updated
       to support innovations like HEVC compression and hybrid broadcast-broadband services (HbbTV), making DVB one of the most
        versatile systems worldwide. </p> 
        
    <h2>3. ISDB (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting)</h2> 
    <p> ISDB was developed in Japan and is also used in Brazil and several other Latin American countries. It is designed to 
      accommodate a variety of services, including HD television, mobile TV, and emergency alert systems. ISDB-T, the terrestrial 
      variant, uses a unique segment-based approach that allows mobile and fixed receivers to function simultaneously, making it 
      particularly useful for disaster response and mobile viewing in densely populated regions. </p> 
      
    <h2>4. DTMB (Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast)</h2> <p> DTMB is the national digital TV standard of China and has been 
      adopted in countries like Pakistan, Laos, and several African nations. It combines technologies from other systems (such as
       DVB and ATSC) and supports both fixed and mobile reception. DTMB is known for its robust signal handling and flexibility, 
       making it well-suited for diverse terrains and crowded urban environments. It supports HD content and is compatible with 
       interactive features and multiple program streams. </p> 
       
    <h2>5. Codec and Compression Standards</h2> 
    <p> Regardless of the transmission standard, all digital TV systems rely on efficient video compression to manage bandwidth. 
      Early broadcasts typically used MPEG-2, while more recent systems utilize MPEG-4 (H.264) and High Efficiency Video Coding 
      (HEVC or H.265). These newer codecs deliver significantly better quality at lower bitrates, enabling high-resolution content
       such as 4K and even 8K video to be streamed or broadcast more efficiently. The use of advanced codecs is essential for 
       minimizing data usage while maximizing visual and audio fidelity. </p>
